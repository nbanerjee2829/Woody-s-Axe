<h3>Game Name</h3>
Woody’s axe

<h3>Genre</h3>
2D Side Scroller Action / Adventure / Metroidvania.

<h3>Theme</h3>
Fantasy / Horror

<h3>Main Gameplay Style</h3>
Hack ‘n slash style combat in a Metroidvania style game.

</h2>Examples of gameplay scenarios involving each of the game mechanics described below</h2>

<h3>Collisions:</h3> The Player, NPCs collide with level tiles to platform through the levels, weapons need to collide with an enemy or a player to inflict or receive damage. The player will use his abilities and weapons to clear out level paths which will be done by using collision detection between his attacks and the level tiles.

<h3>Bullets / Weapons:</h3> The player will have access to 3 different distinct weapons

<h3>NPCs:</h3> There will be basic enemies who will have melee attacks and ranged attacks and some which will cling to the ceiling and upon detecting the player will drop down on them and boss level enemies who will have specific powers and movement systems based on the level. They will be patrolling their region and wont react until they detect the player.

<h3>Moving Tiles:</h3>Levels will have moving platforms for advanced platforming and temporary platforms which will break with time, along with grounds which will break to take you to a different part of the level.

<h3>HP / Damage:</h3> The player will have a fixed life at start and then will be able to get health upgrades if they manage to defeat boss level enemies. Normal enemies would have half of players health and the damage rate would depend on what kind of weapon being used. The boss enemy would have 20 times the health of a player and the damage rate would depend on the weapon of choice or they can use special effects for added damage power.


<h3>Status Effects:</h3> Status effects such as slow which hinders the players movement. Inflicted by enemies or the environment. Poison which causes the player to lose a small amount of health over time until healed or the duration of the poison ends. Invincibility is a power up that makes the player invulnerable to damage for a certain length of time. Helpful in difficult situations.

<h3>Objects / Inventory:</h3> The player will be able to store money and special potions which they get from killing enemies and looting treasures. They will also be able to store their special weapon

<h3>Ray Casting:</h3> The enemies will not react until they detect the player. We will have enemies at the ceiling who will not attack the player until he comes within a certain proximity, there will be enemies who will start chasing the player and look for him when the player gets detected.

<h3>Lighting Effects:</h3> The player will have a torch to light up pathways. Might even include an extra light based weapon to clear out pathways and reveal hidden enemies.

<h3>Gravity / Acceleration:</h3> There will be gravity implemented which will allow the player to fall down and platform levels. Certain enemies will also be able to pull the player towards them.

<h3>Camera / World View:</h3> We will use a basic 2D orthographic view for the basic gameplay. The player will also be able to use a map, which will give them entire view of the level they have traversed

<h3>Pathfinding / Steering:</h3> Enemies will be patrolling their own regions and certain enemies would start chasing the player using pathfinding, once the player gets detected. If the player goes too far away, then they will walk back to their original location. They will detect the player while going back, if the player pops up again.

<h3>Game Progression:</h3> As the player moves through the level, all the paths that the player used will be unlocked in the map to view. The only way the player can progress through levels would be by defeating the boss enemy. We are thinking of adding a new feature to the game where once you defeat the boss enemy, you will be teleported to a safe house / shop where you will be able to use the money to buy upgrades, special potions etc. And once you are ready, you will be teleported to the next level

<h3>Save / Load Game:</h3>  After important progression points the game will be saved for the player to reload at a later date. Currently we are thinking about giving a save point (firepit like Dark Souls) only if they defeat a boss enemy. 

<h3>Shaders:</h3> We are planning to use different looking enemies for different enemy types. And for the boss level enemies, we are planning to give them different appearances based on their health and damage taken. 

<h3>Parallax:</h3> Multiple background layers would be used to give the environment a cool parallax effect.
<h3>User Interface / HUD:</h3> The HUD of the game would include player health, his abilities, resources and boss health bars ( when boss enemy appears). It would also include a minimap of some kind. 

<h3>Sounds:</h3> The game will have background music, audio for actions and gameplay mechanics like jumping, running, attacking, getting hit. Temporary platforms would also have their own sound. There will be sounds for special ability use. Status effects would each have their own audio. Enemies/bosses will have audio cues for certain attacks. Defeating boss level enemies would produce victory audio of some kind to denote level progression.

<h3>Options:</h3> 

We will have an option menu, which will allow the user to choose between different difficulty settings as well as change sound volumes along with allowing you to load or restart the game or quit to the main menu or exit the game.
